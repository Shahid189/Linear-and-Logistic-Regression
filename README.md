# Logistic-Regression 
Logistic Regression project under Prof Ravi Kothari

We worked on two different simple problems where we used logistic regression to predict the classification
The first one was from mnist dataset where we did a binary classification of one vs many type 
I also used the same to do a multiclass classification

Then in the second we use housing dataset to do a prediction for the median rate after doing feature engineering
